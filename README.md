### Build in XCode
The source comes with an XCode 4 project file that should take care of building the library and running the demo app. To use NWService in your project, you can link to its static library, or directly include those source files needed. The latter does require your project to use the LLVM 3.0 compiler with ARC.


### Documentation
Documentation generated and installed by running from the project root:

`appledoc -p NWService -v 0.1 -c Noodlewerk --company-id com.noodlewerk -o . .`

See the [appledoc documentation](http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/) for more info.
